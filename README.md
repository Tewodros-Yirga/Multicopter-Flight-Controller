A flight controller program for a multicopter, inspired by J. Brokking.  

# Multicopter Flight Controller

This is an open-source multicopter flight controller based on Arduino. The project includes:
- Flight controller code
- Setup code
- ESC calibration code
- Schematics for the hardware

## Features  
- Flight stabilization using an MPU6050  
- ESC calibration  
- Custom setup script  

## Project Structure  
- `FlightController/` - Main flight controller program  
- `Setup/` - Initial setup configuration  
- `ESC_Calibration/` - ESC calibration program  
- `Schematics/` - Wiring diagrams  

## Credits
